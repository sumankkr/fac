					<h4> Welcome to FitBeau.com. Our influencer marketing platform is where brands can match with content creators to promote their fitness and beauty products</h4>
					<p style="padding-top:3%;" class="font-class">
						FitBeau was spawned from a fitness and beauty directory site built in 2008 which used facebook and twitter to allow businesses to use their own customers to do their ‘advertising’ for them.

						At the time Facebook was 2 years old (publicly) and twitter only had Steven Fry as their celeb advocate but this was the very start of the future of social media for businesses.

						With our team of fitness and beauty experts, analysts, and developers, and our deep understanding of the evolution of social media, we want to share our insights for you to capitalise on the newest trends fast, so that you stay ahead of the curve.

						<H3><b>So why does FitBeau exist?</b></H3>
						</br>
						The rise of obesity in both adults and children in US and UK is such a big health concern today, that its been called an epedemic. Even the fastest growing economies is the world China and India have the fastest growth of obese childern. Our world's largest and fastest growing countries are starting to wake up to its mental health problems too
						</br> </br>
						Coincidence? Or are these just the side effects of growing an economy's wealth? More luxuries, more inactive, sedentary lifestyles?
						</br> </br>
						It cripples economies not just with lower productivity and sick days, but also puts massive strains on our national health services. It effects all of us
						</br> </br>
						Something has to be done. Something needs to change. Together we can educate the world on how to be fitter, healthier and look good, so we feel great. Together we can share the best products and services out their to help people reach their beauty and fitness goals.
						</br> </br>
						At FitBeau we just provide you, the experts in fitness and beaauty, with a platform to make it a lot easier to do so. No one else is doing it, and we strongly believe it needed to be built
						</br> </br>
						If you want to be part of the change, join us and be part of the movement. Help us create a brighter future, help us build a more FitBeau world
						</br></br></br></br>

					WHAT'S SO DIFFERENT ABOUT THE FITBEAU PLATFORM?
					</br></br>
					<p>
					<B>We're not trying to please everyone</B>, we're only here to provide our services to Fitness and Beauty brands. We won't be distracted by other industries like new gadgets, hotels or video games. We're focused on Your industry, and only listen to Your needs to continously build you a better platform
					</br></br>
					<b>We're focused on small and medium brands</b>, our aim is to meet your specific needs because we know you're looking for cost effective alternatives to traditional online marketing and paid ads which gives you a much high response rate.
					<br>
					</br>
					<b>We're here to help you to fully unlock the potential of influencer marketing.</b> Not only can you view performance of influencers on our site, we can track the perfomance of influencers you already work with. You've built up a relationship with them but probably don't have any way to see their true performance levels.
	
					<br>
					<br>
	
					<b>We target Micro-Influencers (10k - 100k follower)</b> because their followers are almost twice as engaged with their content that those with over 1m followers! They are the most driven to grow their fanbase, and are focused on discovering new products and services so that they can stand out
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Our influencer community is at our platform's core</b>, so unlike every other platform, we're focused on encouraging a sharing and collaborating evnironment where influencers can develop each other to generate better content. We allow them to showcase their skills, content and blogs.
					<br>
					This means newbies and even your loyal customers (your most valuable potential influencers) can be moulding by the community to become your best ambassadors
					</br></br>
					<b>Flexible incentives</b> Maybe you don't want to pay influencers a fee. Perhaps you prefer to offer discounts or free trials instead. FitBeau gives you the option to offer payment, freebies, discounts or a combination of the three.
